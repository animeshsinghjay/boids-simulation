# cop290-starlings

Starlings are small passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas. 
Owing to their lusturous plumage, their family name comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. They are considered an 
invasive species and generally compete for habitat with native birds. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well 
as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific.

Starlings associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. A flock of starlings is called a murmuration. These flocks
may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in 
their roosting behaviour. In the non-breeding season, some roosts can number in the thousands. Flocking behaviour is particularly 
interesting in the case of Starlings as their murmurations are a phenomenal site - like a large organism moving in unison.

In this project, through computer simulations and mathematical models, we try to emulate the flocking behaviour of Starlings. 
Flocking is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities and is a collective animal behavior exhibited 
by many living beings such as birds, fish, bacteria, and insects. It is considered an emergent behavior arising from simple rules 
that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.

Project is implemented in Java using Processing library.
